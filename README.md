## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I learned the benefits of using mobile-first development. This is the first project I've completed that is responsive on both mobile and desktop views.

### Continued development

I'd like to continue to get better with CSS Flexbox and possibly start using CSS Grid. 

### Useful resources

- [CSS Flexbox Guide](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/#flexbox-properties) - This helped me for get familiar with CSS Flexbox. I really liked this site and will continue reviewing it going forward.
